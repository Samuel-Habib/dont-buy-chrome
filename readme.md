# Don't Buy Chrome Extension

Don’t Buy is a Chrome extension that helps people save money by recognizing when they’re about to make a purchase. If the user chooses not to buy the item, the extension saves or invests the amount they would’ve spent. If they buy a cheaper version instead, it saves the difference.

The goal is to prevent spending creep caused by induced demand—when people make smart financial choices but still end up spending the same total each month. Don’t Buy interrupts that cycle by turning avoided purchases into real savings.
